{"name":"Targeting Monocle","type":"wargear","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"For a Rogue Trader, image is everything, both in terms of what it projects and what it conceals. A Targeting Monocle does both—it gives the impression of someone more willing to wear a cumbersome affectation than receive normal ocular augmentics, while secretly providing a dazzling display of information to the user via translucent projections directly to the eye. Distances, wind velocity, infra-red detections, target movement, and more are visible overlaying the normal visual image. Advanced models can link into specially upgraded guns to also include precise firing solutions, ammunition count, and weapon status. A targeting monocle can either be a Motion Predictor, Photo Sight, Preysense Sight, or Telescopic Sight (this is determined when the monocle is acquired). However, it requires a Very Hard (–30) Scrutiny Test to determine this is anything but a Monocle.
