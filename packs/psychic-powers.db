This chitin may not be removed as it is fused to the psyker&rsquo;s skeletal and muscular systems, but as such it functions as an extension of his own body. Each Degree of Success on the Focus Power Test may be &ldquo;spent&rdquo; to add armour to one part of the body (head, body, both arms, or both legs). This armour has a rating of AP 2. However, the psyker may alternatively spend successes to increase the Armour Points on one of the above listed body parts on a one for one basis. For example, a psyker scores three Successes on his Focus Power Test and chooses to add chitin to his head and arms (spending two successes) and to increase the armour to his head by one (using the last success) for a result of a head with AP 3 armour and arms with AP 2 armour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","type":"String"},"action":{"value":"Half Action","type":"String"},"subtype":{"value":"Concentration","type":"String"},"discipline":{"value":"Biomancy","type":"String"},"testChar":{"value":"wp","type":"Characteristic"},"sustain":{"value":"Free Action","type":"String"},"curPR":{"value":1,"number":"Number"},"reqs":{"value":"Psy Rating 2, Toughness 30+","type":"String"},"target":{"value":0,"type":"Number"},"training":{"value":"","type":"String"},"cost":{"value":"200","type":"Number"}},"effects":[{"label":"Chitin Shell","changes":[],"transfer":true,"disabled":true,"_id":"wyNh8QliCwGwMC02","duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"combat":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null},"icon":null,"origin":null,"tint":null,"flags":{}}],"flags":{"fortyk":{"ignoreCover":true,"ignoreSoak":true},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.IQBcwMNfaUlJPmRS"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"fortyk","systemVersion":"0.10.2.3.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672078091496,"modifiedTime":1675108840820,"lastModifiedBy":"rH1O3GTgaMN2UUme"},"_id":"cWkGBxXls7LGTQlL","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"rH1O3GTgaMN2UUme":3}}
