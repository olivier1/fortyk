However, the strain these chemicals place upon the body damages the same functions it enhances with each use. A single dose of Barrage grants the user the Unnatural Perception (x2), Unnatural Strength (x2) and Unnatural Toughness (x2) talents for 1d5 rounds.

A creature exposed to Burnscour Rain must pass a Difficult (–10) Toughness Test or immediately suffer 1d5 Strength and Toughness damage (roll separately for each), and an additional 1d5 Strength and Toughness damage for every Degree of Failure on the test.  However, so dangerous is this poison that it takes a Difficult (–10) Chem-Use Test to successfully apply it to a weapon, load it into a dispenser or otherwise handle a dose.

Geist is extraordinarily dangerous when used on non-psykers, who lack the necessary mental discipline to control the sudden surge in power. In psykers, the increase in power the drug induces can be unpredictable, but valuable. Such stimulants, often blended with tiny amounts of slaught, and human blood, have been used by notorious witches and sorcerers in the Koronus Expanse, making the Calixian Ordos ever more eager to outlaw them. In any character without a Psy Rating, use of Geist causes an immediate Psychic Phenomena result. In characters with a Psy Rating, a dose of Geist grants the character two additional points of Psy Rating for 1d5+1 minutes.

{"name":"Glimmer","type":"wargear","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"A particularly unusual narcotic, Glimmer is a mildly toxic substance which seems to have no other discernible effects when injected, inhaled or ingested. However, when light is filtered through a small quantity of this orange-red fluid, it induces a state of extreme relaxation and apparent intoxication upon any who are exposed to the light. The chemical dries up after a few moments of exposure to bright light, but the resultant luminescence lingers for far longer. Most users are known to share the drug, setting up mirrored rooms and loading glass filters filled with the fluid into the front of glow-lamps. The diffuse ruddy glow of these rooms leaves its occupants in a dreamlike state for around an hour after initial exposure. Addicts often go a step further, applying the substance as eye-drops and taking in the filtered light directly, experiencing the effects far more swiftly and more strongly. Those who use in this way soon become blind, as the substance damages their eyes beyond repair. Using Glimmer imposes a –1d10 penalty to Perception and Willpower for about an hour, and users must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or become unconscious (fall asleep). Nobody is entirely certain of where Glimmer comes from; it simply appeared on the black markets on several worlds about five years ago, proving to be particularly popular amongst the light-obsessed nobles of Scintilla. Rumours persist that vast lakes of the substance exist on a world deep in the Koronus Expanse, under the faint light of an old and dying star. Of similar concern is the fact that the drug seems to have no discernible effects on any creatures except humans.","type":"String"},"weight":0,"rarity":{"value":-20,"type":"String"},"amount":{"value":1,"taken":0,"left":0,"type":"Number"},"quality":{"value":"Common","type":"String"},"space":{"value":0,"type":"Number"},"state":{"value":"","type":"String"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AGchlmaYleRSrQid":3},"flags":{},"_id":"2fyFTHy4VmDXzosH"}

A tox-mister contains a tiny replaceable reservoir that can be filled with any liquid; these reservoirs are sealed and easily interchangeable, allowing a would-be poisoner to switch quickly between payloads. A tox-mister can only deliver a poison up to a metre away, creating a tiny cloud of droplets that hang in the air momentarily. A tox-mister can be used to administer poisons even in close combat, requiring a Weapon Skill Test as normal for any attack performed at such a short range, though the spray from a tox-mister  cannot be parried, only dodged.
