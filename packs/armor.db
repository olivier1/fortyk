Any Acolyte without the Adeptus Mechanicus background gains the Enemy (Adeptus Mechanicus) talent while openly wearing or displaying Praetor Armour.","type":"String"},"weight":{"value":16,"total":0,"type":"Number"},"rarity":{"value":-40,"type":"String"},"amount":{"value":1,"taken":0,"left":0,"type":"Number"},"quality":{"value":"Common","type":"String"},"space":{"value":0,"type":"Number"},"state":{"value":"","type":"String"},"isEquipped":false,"maxAgi":{"value":"50","type":"Number"},"ap":{"head":{"value":"6","type":"Number"},"body":{"value":"6","type":"Number"},"lArm":{"value":"6","type":"Number"},"rArm":{"value":"6","type":"Number"},"lLeg":{"value":"6","type":"Number"},"rLeg":{"value":"6","type":"Number"}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AGchlmaYleRSrQid":3},"flags":{},"_id":"6542jW4kZZ3cfi5Y"}

Unlike many such illicit creations, Footfall-pattern voidsuits are of remarkably high quality, the explorers and colonists of the Expanse being extremely familiar with the dangers of the void, and thus less-than-willing to risk themselves with creations of uncertain protective value. Less cumbersome than the widely-used Selenite-pattern, it provides somewhat less protection from hazards, but is more comfortable to wear for long periods of time, such that many voidmen wear the main body of the suit as normal work overalls, adding the helm, gauntlets and boots only when they need to work in vacuum.  When fully sealed, the suit’s rebreather tanks provide enough air for four hours, after which time they must be replaced, which can be done as a Full Action without compromising the suit’s seals and without removing the suit.

The finest and most extravagant of mesh-woven clothes are believed to incorporate elements of mesh armour salvaged from the bodies of Eldar warriors, the armour being extraordinarily lightweight and almost as fine as silk, and thus easily added to fine clothing without looking particularly out of place.

Adeptus Arbites boarding parties, such as those serving as part of the Calixis Sector’s Precinct Astra, tend to employ suits of pressure carapace during their raids upon illegal shipping, though they are far from the only organisation to use this type of armour.  Given their intended use, suits of pressure carapace are somewhat resistant to the normal tears and punctures that are a hazard in vacuum combat. Against any attack that would normally cause a suit puncture, roll 1d10—on a 6+, the suit’s construction holds up and no puncture is caused.

Recently, however, this jet-black or dark blue armour has shown up more often, reportedly smuggled from distant locations by several Rogue Traders with ties to the Imperial Navy. The Inquisition is quite eager to find these individuals, and learn the source of these sales.  Tyranid chitin is roughly as protective as flak or light carapace armour. Owning a suit of xenos chitin armour is considered to be a heresy, and consequently will attract unfavourable attention from the Inquisition, Adeptus Arbites, Ecclesiarchy and others besides.
