Note that this does not include an understanding of complex theories or the terminology involved with them&mdash;that would fall more commonly under Scholastic Lore.&nbsp;</p> <p>All characters have some inherent ability to exercise Logic, observing cause and effect and making inferences regarding likely outcomes. In many instances, a character&rsquo;s ability to comprehend logical phenomena might be impeded by his belief systems, including his faith in the Imperial Creed or the Omnissiah. Characters who frequently need to identify or resolve complex situations can hone this skill through frequent use. The variables involved in any problem determine the inherent difficulty of a Logic test.</p> <p>If a character is provided with all of the necessary background information, a reasonably adept character should be able to successfully solve the problem. If there are too many unknown factors, the problem might only be solved after uncovering additional clues, or through prodigious luck.&nbsp;</p> <p>The GM can call on a player to use the Logic skill when:&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He must solve a riddle or puzzle.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He is looking for clues in a vast amount of seemingly unrelated information.</p> <p>&bull; He is trying to win at a game of chance.</p>","type":"String"},"parent":{"value":"","type":"String"},"hasChildren":{"value":false,"type":"Boolean"},"type":"Number","value":-20,"characteristic":{"type":"String","value":"int"},"mod":{"value":0,"type":"Number"},"total":{"value":0,"type":"Number"},"aptitudes":{"value":"Intelligence, Knowledge","type":"String"},"skillUse":{"value":"1 minute, or longer for particularly complex problems.","type":"String"}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"wsvVyRr3wYfUADv6"}
