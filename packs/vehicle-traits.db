{"_id":"jub2QffducilDjhh","name":"Living","type":"talentntrait","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This vehicle is a flesh and blood creature (or at the very least incorporates such a being into its chassis) which is used as a steed or conveyance. It has the standard set of characteristics, but follows the rules for other vehicles in many other ways. It takes damage in the same way as a vehicle, but the Game Master should modify the way some effects occur, especially for Critical damage results. For instance, if a steed suffers a hit to its &ldquo;motive systems&rdquo; location, it might suffer a vicious gash in its leg rather than having a tyre explode. Explosive or Fire effects might similarly be translated into terrible disembowelments or skeletal destruction. Rather than needing promethium to keep it functional and repairs to restore lost function, a steed would require feed and rest to continue carrying its rider, and time and care to recover from injury. Living vehicles can sometimes be repaired with the Tech- Use skill if they have cybernetic components. For fully organic creatures, however, the GM should treat wounds and critical wounds as normal for the purposes of healing like other living creatures, which can occur via natural healing (see page 244) or with use of the Medicae skill. Vehicles with this trait can have a variety of traits like other creatures (commonly Flyer or Quadruped), along with other vehicle traits where applicable such as Walker. A character can ride any Living mount with a Size trait larger than his own Size trait unless the mount&rsquo;s specific traits or abilities say otherwise. Riding a mount uses the Wrangling special use of the Survival skill (as per page 116). Simply riding most steeds under normal conditions does not usually require a test, but when performing vehicle actions that would require the rider to make an Operate test, he makes a Survival test instead. Living vehicles use profiles much like standard NPCs, and follow many of the same rules that they do when in combat. See Chapter XII: NPCs and Adversaries for more information on NPC types and rules.</p>","type":"String"},"tier":{"value":"N/A","type":"Number"},"prereqs":{"value":"N/A","type":"String"},"aptitudes":{"value":"N/A","type":"String"},"specialisation":{"value":"N/A","type":"String"},"flagId":{"value":"living","type":"String"},"tags":{"value":"vehicle","type":"String"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"6zwBg86XUSZ7ctUU":3},"flags":{}}
