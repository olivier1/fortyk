        "value": "<p>Acrobatics covers feats of agile movement, graceful motion, and mastery of balance and form. With this skill, characters can leap nimbly across gaping chasms, maintain their balance on a pitching ship deck, or fall gracefully to the ground without snapping their limbs. In combat, an accomplished acrobat can somersault, flip, or cartwheel away from foes, twisting his body out of reach of his enemy or slipping past foes in a blur of motion.&nbsp;</p> <p>Often, characters develop a knack for Acrobatics as part of their training in another field. A courier or thief might learn these knacks as part of travel through densely populated areas. Gladiators, survivalists, and dancers need to be able to perform acrobatic motions as part of their daily routines. Even a Tech- Adept accustomed to working in particularly confined quarters devotes his daily flesh-exhortations to improving flexibility, so that he might more effectively work within narrow ductwork.&nbsp;</p> <p>The GM can call on a player to use the Acrobatics skill when:&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He must keep his balance or avoid falling in unstable ground.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He wishes to jump down from a height and land well.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He wants to move over or around a foe or obstacle in his path without breaking his stride.</p> <p>The following are special uses for the Acrobatics skill:&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Contortionist:</strong> A character can use his Acrobatics skill to escape from bonds or the grip of a foe by twisting and turning his body. As a Full Action, a character may make an Acrobatics skill test to free himself from bonds, such as rope, manacles, or the like. This test can only be attempted once to escape restraints; if the character fails to free himself the first time, then he is simply too tightly bound and unable to contort his way free. The GM can modify this test depending on the quality of the bonds in this situation. Characters may also use Acrobatics to escape from a grapple (see page 221) by using their Acrobatics skill instead of their Agility or Strength when grappling.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Manoeuvring:&nbsp;</strong>In combat, a character capable of acrobatics can more easily avoid foes or retreat from combat without harm. The character may make a Disengage action (see page 220) as a Half Action (rather than a Full Action) if he passes a Challenging (+0) Acrobatics skill test.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Jumping:</strong> A well-trained acrobat excels at jumping, leaping, and lessening the effect of falls by folding his body as he hits the ground. When jumping or leaping (see page 222), a character may use the Acrobatics skill in the place of Agility and Strength tests. When determining Falling damage, a character can make an Acrobatics skill test to reduce the effective distance fallen by a number of metres equal to his Agility bonus.</p>",

Athletics measures a character&rsquo;s ability to run long distances without tiring, climb sheer surfaces, and lift heavy loads. It also allows a character to push himself to greater levels of endurance and shrug off the effects of fatigue when running, swimming, or climbing. A character&rsquo;s background might dispose him more towards certain types of athletics.&nbsp;</p> <p>A GM can keep this in mind when determining the difficulty of a test. For example, a character from a desert world or could be required to make more difficult Athletics tests to swim across a river than an Acolyte who grew up on an aquatic agri-world would.&nbsp;</p> <p>The GM can call on a player to use the Athletics skill when:&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He must swim across a body of water or try to stay afloat.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He wishes to push himself beyond his limits and keep going even when exhausted.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He wants to climb a cliff or cross extremely rough ground.&nbsp;</p> <p>The following are special uses for the Athletics skill:&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Trained athletes are extremely fit and can push themselves far beyond the ability of normal people. As a Free Action, a character with the Athletics skill can make a Difficult (&ndash;10) Athletics skill test whenever he suffers a level of Fatigue (see page 233) as a result of running, swimming, or climbing to ignore its effects. The character can continue to take tests and ignore Fatigue gained in this way indefinitely; however, as soon as he fails a test, he must rest for at least 4 hours and cannot use his Athletics skill again during that time.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Heft:</strong> Athletes are also known for their strength and can lift great weights for short periods of time. As a Free Action, a character can make a Challenging (+0) Athletics skill test to increase his carrying capability for a single encounter. For every degree of success the character achieves, his Strength is increased by 10 for the purposes of how much weight he can carry, lift, or drag (see page 248), to a maximum modified Strength of 100. Hefting can only be attempted once, and if the character fails the test, he cannot try again until the next encounter.</p>",

In general, Awareness is used when trying to spot items or individuals that are either hidden or not easy to notice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Scrutiny (see page 114) is used to interpret hidden emotions, motivations, or other undercurrents. So while spotting someone hidden would be Awareness, determining whether someone is lying or being deceitful would be Scrutiny. When Awareness is used against an opponent (such as to spot an ambush) it is an Opposed test (see page 24). Awareness opposes and is opposed by Stealth.&nbsp;</p> <p>The GM can call on a player to use the Awareness skill when:&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He is walking into an ambush or being spied upon by a hidden foe.</p> <p>&bull; He wants to search an area for clues or find a hidden item.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He is trying to eavesdrop on a conversation or there is a chance of overhearing some pertinent information.&nbsp;</p> <p>The following is a special use for the Awareness skill:&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Lip Reading:</strong> Lip reading allows an Acolyte to effectively understand a conversation even though he cannot hear it.

The difficulty of this test is modified &ndash;10 for every 10 metres of distance between the character and the speaker.&nbsp;</p> <p>The GM can assign other penalties for darkness, fog, or other factors affecting vision; magnoculars or other vision enhancing devices can help offset this penalty or provide a bonus. A successful Awareness skill test reveals the general gist of the conversation, such as talking about a drop point or the location of a cult gathering. Additional degrees of success reveal correspondingly more information.&nbsp;</p> <p>The character need not make a skill test every round, as one degree of success is enough to follow the conversation for the span of roughly one topic.

Instead, the character&rsquo;s persuasive efforts are dependent upon perceived generosity and good intentions.

When attempting to use a language the character knows, a Linguistics test is only required for a particularly difficult task, such as translating an ancient version of the language or attempting to understand a garbled vox-intercept. Unknown languages, however, always require a Linguistics test to understand on even a basic level.&nbsp;</p> <p>A character might need to speak with a human from a rediscovered world that was forgotten for millennia, or a researcher may need to comprehend a xenos prophecy that predates the Great Crusade. Communicating with those whose language is foreign depends upon a character&rsquo;s knowledge and aptitude in the Linguistics skill. Two key factors play into determining the difficulty for a Linguistics test. The first is the complexity of the message; simple greetings or warnings are far easier to interpret than more complex philosophical or religious concepts. Such communications might not necessitate a test, even if the message is delivered in an entirely foreign tongue.&nbsp;</p> <p>The second difficulty factor is a measure of how foreign the language is to any the character knows. If the communication arrives in a pidgin or archaic dialect of the character&rsquo;s native tongue, then translation could be challenging, but feasible. Conversely, if the message is in a language that a xenos race developed in an entirely different part of the galaxy, deciphering it without additional context might be impossible. Any character who has this a skill knows how to read and write in his primary language. For most of the Imperium, this is Low Gothic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Note that all Acolytes are capable of basic communication in Low Gothic that would not require a skill test, such as normal conversation or reading standard Munitorum manuals.

        "value": "<p>The Survival skill is a measure of a character&rsquo;s ability to subsist without the support of civilisation. It is absolutely vital for those who dwell in the untamed wilds, far from the protection of fortified encampments or cities. Those who live within the urban jungles of underhives or city ruins must also achieve some mastery of this field, as they cannot depend upon reliable sources of food and water. The knacks associated with this field often have applications even within structured society, especially for those with a more independent nature.&nbsp;</p> <p>A character with the Survival skill can live off the land, ride beasts, and predict weather with only a minimum of equipment and without the need for resupply or support. It can be used to create primitive items such as bows or blades, as well as basic clothing. Survival is also used to track prey (human or otherwise) across all kinds of terrain by following the tell-tale signs they leave on the environment around them.&nbsp;</p> <p>The difficulty for a Survival test is associated with the environmental constraints where it is made. If a planet&rsquo;s atmosphere, fauna, and water are laced with deadly toxins, then finding the materials necessary for life could be nearly impossible. Use of the skill does not only indicate a knack for finding life&rsquo;s essentials; it can also indicate an aptitude for avoiding the deadliest of threats.&nbsp;</p> <p>The GM can call on a player to use the Survival skill when:</p> <p>&bull; He wants to find food or water in a hostile environment.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He wishes to start a fire with only handmade tools.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He is trying to track a foe across the depths of an underhive.</p>",

It can also be used to build basic or complex technical devices with the right amount of time and materials. Tech-Use is more an understanding of the Blessings of the Omnissiah and the rites of the Machine Cult than it is an actual knowledge of the science behind technology&mdash;in the 41 st Millennium, however, this amounts to the same thing.&nbsp;</p> <p>The difficulty for this skill use is related to the complexity of the device and its design nature. A simple tool of Eldar origin, for example, might be every bit as dangerous as a venting plasma gun to the uninitiated. Conversely, no amount of familiarity with the blessed design principles of a Warp engine can make it an easily understood device.&nbsp;</p> <p>The GM can call on a player to use the Tech-Use skill when:</p> <p>&bull; He wants to repair a broken weapon or vehicle.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; He wishes to push a piece of technology beyond its normal capabilities or operating parameters.</p> <p>&bull; He is trying to determine how a piece of unknown or unfamiliar technology works.</p>",
