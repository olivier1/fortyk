A suppression shield is a one-handed weapon, and grants +4 APs to that arm and the wielder’s torso. Good and Best Craftsmanship suppression shields have a weapon lock that lets the wielder brace a rifle against the edge of the shield. A character wielding a suppression shield with a weapon lock can wield a single Basic weapon in his other hand without the normal penalty for using a Basic weapon one-handed."
