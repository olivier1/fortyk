In addition, whenever a psyker damages an opponent, he may take a Focus Power action (Opposed with Willpower) as a Half Action. If he wins the test, then for every degree of success, the Force weapon’s wielder deals an additional 1d10 Energy damage, ignoring Armour and Toughness bonus.

        "label": "Indirect",
        "description": "Many weapons are designed to be fired in high arcs at unseen foes or thrown from protective cover at charging enemies. Indirect weapons do not require line of sight to their target, but the attacker must still be aware of his intended target’s location, either through last known position, use of a spotter, or other means. When making any ranged attack action (Standard Attack, Semi-Auto Burst, or Full Auto Burst) with an Indirect weapon, the attack does not have to target a location in line of sight of the active player, but is made at a –10 penalty and requires a Full Action instead of the normal Half Action. The GM makes the final determination on whether the character is aware of his target’s location, and can add penalties to this ranged attack based on how aware the character is of his target. For each hit the ranged attack inflicts, roll once on the Scatter Diagram (see page 230). The hit instead strikes the ground at a location a number of metres away from the intended target, in the direction rolled on the Scatter Diagram, equal to 1d10 minus the firer’s Ballistic Skill bonus (to a minimum of zero). If the ranged attack fails, or if the Semi-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst actions fail to achieve the maximum potential hits, the remaining missed hits—up to the maximum potential hits for the rate of fire used in the attack—are still fired, but miss their target. For each missed hit, roll once on the Scatter Diagram. The hit instead strikes the ground at a location Xd10 metres away from the intended target in the direction rolled on the Scatter Diagram, where X is equal to the number in parentheses (X)."

When the weapon is fired on Maximal, it adds 10 metres to its range, 1d10 to its damage, and +2 to its penetration.

The wielder may choose to avoid taking the damage by dropping the weapon as a Free Action.

When a weapon with this quality is used to make an attack, that weapon cannot be used to attack again until the end of the next round (in effect, it can only be used once every other round)."

        "description": "The standard ammunition of these weapons spreads out when fired, ripping apart targets at close range but inflicting considerably less harm from afar. When fired at Point Blank range, this weapon gains +10 to hit and deals +3 damage. When fired at Short range, it gains +10 to hit. At any longer ranges, it suffers –3 damage."

A target that takes at least 1 point of damage from a Shocking weapon (after Armour and Toughness bonus) must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness test. If he fails, he suffers 1 level of Fatigue and is Stunned for a number of rounds equal to half of his degrees of failure (rounding up)."

When a hit is scored from a weapon with this quality, it creates a smokescreen at the point of impact with a radius in metres equal to the number in parentheses (X).

When a target is struck by a weapon with this quality, it must make an Agility test with a penalty equal ten times the number in parentheses (X) or be Immobilised. For example, a weapon with Snare (1) would impose a –10 penalty on this test. An Immobilised target can attempt no actions other than trying to escape the bonds. As a Full Action, he can make a Challenging (+0) Strength or Agility test, with a penalty equal to ten times the number in parentheses (X). If he succeeds, he bursts free or wriggles out.

        "description": "Spray weapons use large area-effect shots to strike more foes, sacrificing range for wider coverage. Unlike other weapons,they have just one range and, when fired, hit all those in their area of effect. The wielder does not need to test Ballistic Skill; all creatures in the weapon’s path (a cone-shaped area extending in a 30° arc from the firer out to the weapon’s range) must make a Challenging (+0) Agility test or suffer one hit from the weapon. If the wielder does not possess the appropriate Weapon Training talent, targets gain a +20 bonus on the test; this rises to +30 if the weapon is Heavy and the wielder is not braced. Cover does not protect from Spray attacks unless it completely conceals a target. Because there is no attack roll, they are always considered to strike the Body location. They jam if the firer rolls a 9 on any damage dice (before any modifiers are applied). Due to the inaccurate nature of their design, they cannot be used to make Called Shot actions."

At the end of his turn, if a character has suffered damage (after Armour and Toughness bonus) in the last round from a weapon with this quality, he must make a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X) or suffer 1d10 additional damage (of the same type as the first weapon with this quality to damage him that round). For example, a weapon with Toxic (4) imposes a –40 on the tests to resist its effects.

A weapon with this quality gains a +20 to hit when fired and uses twice as much ammunition.
