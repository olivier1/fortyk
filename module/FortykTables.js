However, he also gains 1 Corruption point.","Unnatural Decay: All plant life within [[3d10]] metres of the psyker withers and dies.","Spectral Gale: Howling winds erupt around the psyker, requiring each character (including the psyker) within [[4d10]] metres to make an Easy (+30) Agility or Strength test to avoid being knocked Prone.","Bloody Tears: Blood weeps from stone and wood within [[3d10]] metres of the psyker. If there are any paintings, pict-displays, statues, or other representations of people inside this area, they appear to be crying blood.","The Earth Protests: The ground suddenly shakes, and each character (including the psyker) within a [[5d10]] metre radius must make an Ordinary (+10) Agility test or be knocked down.","Actinic Discharge: Static electricity fills the air within [[5d10]] metres causing hair to stand on end and unprotected electronics to short out, while the psyker is wreathed in eldritch lightning. The GM is free to resolve the specifics as needed, perhaps using Table 5&ndash;4: Haywire Field Effects (see page 147) to provide guidance.","Warp Ghosts: Ghostly apparitions fill the air within [[3d10]] metres around the psyker, flying about and howling in pain for a few brief moments. Each character in the radius (except the psyker himself) must test against Fear (1).","Falling Upwards: Everything within [[2d10]] metres of the psyker (including the psyker himself) rises [[1d10]] metres into the air as gravity briefly ceases. Almost immediately, everything crashes back to earth, suffering falling damage as appropriate for the distances fallen.","Banshee Howl: A shrill keening rings out across the immediate area, shattering glass and forcing each living creature able to hear it (including the psyker) to pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness test or be deafened for [[1d10]] rounds.","The Furies: The Psyker is assailed by unseen horrors. He is slammed to the ground and suffers [[1d5]] Impact damage (ignoring Armour, but not Toughness bonus) and he must test against Fear (2).","Shadow of the Warp: For a split second, the world changes in appearance, and everyone within [[1d100]] metres has a brief but horrific glimpse of the shadow of the Warp. Each character in the area (including the psyker) must make a Difficult (&ndash;10) Willpower test or gain [[1d5]] Corruption points.","Tech Scorn: The machine spirits reject these unnatural ways. All un-warded technology within [[5d10]] metres malfunctions momentarily, and all ranged weapons jam (see page 224). Each character (including the psyker) withing that range with cybernetic implants must pass an Ordinary (+10) Toughness test or suffer [[1d5]] Rending damage, ignoring Toughness bonus and Armour.","Warp Madness: A violent ripple of tainted discord causes all characters (except the psyker) within [[2d10]] metres to make a Difficult (&ndash;10) Willpower test; each character who fails gains [[1d5]] Corruption points and becomes Frenzied for 1 round (see page 127).","Perils of the Warp: The Warp opens in a wild maelstrom of unnatural energy.

    "Warp Burn: A violent burst of energy from the Warp smashes into the psyker’s mind, sending him reeling. He suffers [[2d5]] Energy damage, ignoring Toughness bonus and Armour, and is Stunned for [[1d5]] rounds.",
    "Psychic Concussion: With a crack of energy, the psyker is knocked unconscious for [[1d5]] rounds, and everyone within [[3d10]] metres must make an Ordinary (+10) Willpower test or be Stunned for one round.",
    "Psy Blast: There is an explosion of power and the psyker is thrown [[3d10]] metres into the air, plummeting to the ground moments later (see page 243 for rules concerning falling damage).",
    "Soul Sear: Warp power courses through the psyker’s body, scorching his soul. The psyker cannot use any psychic powers for the next hour, and gains [[2d5]] Corruption points.",
    "Locked In: The power cages the psyker’s mind in an ethereal prison, tormented by visions of the Warp. The psyker falls to the ground Prone and Unconscious. At the beginning of each of his turns until he breaks free, he must spend a Full Action to make a Difficult (–10) Willpower test. If he succeeds, his mind is freed and restored to his body, haunted by his experiences but otherwise unharmed.",
    "Chronological Incontinence: Time warps around the psyker. He winks out of existence and reappears in [[1d10]] rounds (or one minute in narrative time) in the exact location. He suffers one point of permanent Toughness and Intelligence damage as his body and mind rebel against the experience, and gains [[1d5]] Corruption points.",
    "Psychic Mirror: The psyker’s power is turned back on him. Resolve the power’s effects, but the power targets the psyker instead. If the power is beneficial, it deals [[1d10+5]] Energy damage (ignoring Armour) to the psyker’s Body instead of having its normal effect.",
    "Warp Whispers: The voices of Daemons fill the air within [[4d10]] metres of the psyker, whispering terrible secrets and shocking truths. Each character in range (including the psyker) must make a Hard (–20) Willpower test or gain [[1d5]] Corruption points and suffer an equal amount of Willpower damage. Whether or not the psyker passes the Willpower test, he suffers an additional [[1d5+5]] Willpower damage.",
    "Vice Versa: The psyker’s mind is thrown out of his body and into another nearby creature or person. The psyker and a random living creature (friend or foe, but not a Daemon, machine, or other “soulless” entity) within 50 metres swap consciousness for [[1d10]] rounds. Each creature retains its Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship during the swap, but uses the other characteristics of the host body. If either body is slain, the effect ends immediately and both parties return to their original bodies. Both suffer [[1d5]] Intelligence damage from the experience. If there are no creatures within range, the psyker becomes catatonic for [[1d5]] rounds while his mind wanders the Warp. This journey inflicts [[1d10]] Willpower damage, [[1d10]] Intelligence damage, and [[1d10]] Corruption points.",
    "Dark Summoning: The Empyrean buckles and tears at the arrogance of the psyker, and a Plaguebearer (see page 415) or another lesser Daemon at the GM’s discretion rips its way into existence. The pestilent fiend appears within [[3d10]] metres of the psyker, for a number of rounds equal to [[1d5]] plus the psyker’s Toughness bonus. The psyker’s turn immediately ends, and the Daemon takes its turn immediately. It detests the psyker and focuses all of its attacks upon the fool who unwittingly summoned it. It does not attack anyone else, even if others attack it; if the psyker is slain, it returns back to the Warp, satisfied with its kill.",
    "Rending the Veil: The air vibrates with images of cackling Daemons and the kaleidoscopic fabric of the Warp is rendered visible to mortal eyes. All sentient creatures within [[1d100]] metres must test against Fear (2). The psyker must test against Fear (4) instead. This effect lasts for [[1d5]] rounds.",
    "Blood Rain: A psychic storm erupts, covering an area of [[5d10]] metres. Each character in range (including the psyker) must make a Challenging (+0) Strength test or be knocked Prone. In addition to howling winds and rains of blood, any psychic powers used in the area for [[1d5]] rounds automatically invoke Perils of the Warp, in addition to any Psychic Phenomena caused. The psyker gains [[1d5+1]] Corruption points.",
    "Cataclysmic Blast: The psyker’s power overloads, arcing out in great bolts of Warp energy. Each character within [[1d10]] metres (including the psyker) takes [[1d10]] Energy damage with a Pen of 5. The psyker may not Dodge this, or stop the attack with a force field (see page 168). In addition, all of the psyker’s clothing, armour, and gear is destroyed, leaving him naked and smoking on the ground, and he cannot use further powers for [[1d5]] hours after the event.",
    "Mass Incursion: Chaos Furies (page 417) emerge from the Warp, hungry for souls. Each character within [[1d100]] metres of the psyker (including himself) must make a Hard (–20) Willpower test or gain [[1d10]] Corruption and Insanity points, and suffer [[1d10]] Willpower damage. Each character who succeeds is attacked physically by a Fury, which departs after [[1d5]] rounds.",
    "Reality Quake: Reality buckles around the psyker, and an area radiating out [[3d10]] metres from him is sundered: solid objects alternately rot, burn, and freeze, and everyone and everything in the area suffers a single hit for [[2d10]] Rending damage that ignores Armour and cannot be Dodged. Warded objects, Daemons, and Untouchables halve the damage they would suffer.",
    "Grand Incursion: A great and terrible Warp entity takes an interest in the psyker's flesh. Use the profile for Putricifex, Herald of Nurgle from page 416 (or another suitably powerful Daemon) to represent the attacker, who instantly makes an Opposed Very Hard (–20) Willpower test against the psyker. If the Daemon wins, it possesses the psyker's body for 1 hour per degree by which it won the test. The psyker gains [[2d10]] Insanity and Corruption points and is controlled by the Daemon until the effect ends. If he dies while possessed, the Daemon physically manifests for the remainder of the effect's duration. If the psyker wins the test, he suffers [[2d10]] Toughness damage, and forever adds +10 to all rolls on Table 6–2: Psychic Phenomena and Table 6–3: Perils of the Warp, as his polluted body now serves as a Warp conduit.",
    "Annihilation: The psyker is immediately burned to ashes by the screaming fires of the Immaterium or dragged into the deepest maelstrom of the Warp. He cannot burn Fate to avert this death and is irrevocably destroyed. There is a chance that a daemonic entity of some sort appears in his place—the type of Daemon is determined by the GM, based on how powerful the psyker was, as more powerful psykers draw more powerful Daemons. The percentage chance that the Daemon appears is equal to the psyker’s Willpower characteristic (roll a [[1d100]], if the result is equal to or under the characteristic, the Daemon appears)."

The sounds are decidedly unnatural and seem unmistakably to emenate from the Weirdboy.","Movin' Stuff: Within [[1d100]] metres of the Weirdboy, all loose objects weighing 1kg or less variously float or are flung [[1d10]] metres in a random direction. This storm of detritus is too light to cause harm.","Bizarre Growth: [[1d5+2]] clusters of luridly-coloured mushrooms, each a metre across and a metre tall, suddenly burst out of the ground within 25m of the Weirdboy. These mushrooms provide 1 AP to anyone taking cover behind them. All of the mushrooms have the Weirdboy's face.","Ded Smelly: Acrid green smoke pours from the Weirdboy's ears, nose, and other orifices, preventing him from speaking for the next Round. The smoke imposes a -20 penalty on Awareness Tests based on sight or smell, as it stings the eyes and fills the nostrils with the smell of rotting squig-meat.","An Odd Feeling: Hundreds of conflicting emotions and sensations, none of which are familiar to the Weirdboy, rush into his mind. The resulting confusion causes the Weirdboy to gain [[1d5]] Insanity Points.","Sparkly and Glowy: Bizarre flashing lights fill the air around the Weirdboy, imposing a penalty equal to twice the Weirdboy's Psy Rating on all Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made within 10 metres.","Sleepy... so sleepy: The Weirdboy suddenly feels very, very tired and gains [[1d5]] + Psy Rating levels of Fatigue. If the Weirdboy is rendered unconscious, the bizarre dreams he experiences cause him to gain [[1d5]] Insanity Points.","All Gone Dark: For the remainder of the Round, the area within [[3d10]]m of the Weirdboy is plunged into absolute and impossible darkness.","Angry and Loud: A sudden surge of Waaagh! energy fills the air, inspiring nearby creatures to violence. All living creatures within 30m are immediately subject to the effects of the Frenzy Talent. Non-Orks within that distance may attempt a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test to resist this effect. The Weirdboy instead gains [[1d5]] Insanity Points.","Dizzy and Bewildered: The Weirdboy is suddenly unsure of which direction is which. Worse, this confusion seems contagious. The Weirdboy is immediately knocked prone and is Stunned for [[1d5]] Rounds. Any other creature within 10m of the Weirdboy must pass a Challenging (+0) Perception Test or also suffer the same effects.","Gork's Shout: The air is filled with a thunderous, monstrous noise, the sound of some titanic beast bellowing an inhuman war cry. All living creatures in the area must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or be deafened for [[1d10]] Rounds. Orks that pass this Test join in the shout, immediately recovering from the effects of Fear or Pinning.","Mork's Cunnin': A barrage of ideas and images fills the Weirdboy's mind, but so swift and violent is this mental onslaught that little remains of use. The Weirdboy gains a number of Insanity Points equal to [[1d10]] minus his Intelligence Bonus, but may re-roll a single failed Intelligence Test in the next 24 hours.","Fire and Thunder: Green embers fill the air, bursting into emerald flames upon all they touch and issuing forth a thunderous roar. All flammable objects within 30m immediately catch fire, and all creatures within that distance must pass a Difficult (-10) Agility Test or catch aflame as well.","Manifest Violence: Insubstantial green hands drift around, shoving and grabbing and hitting everyone within reach.

At the end of the last Round of this delay, the power resolves exactly as if it had just been used.","Vessel of Da Waaagh!: Overcome with accumulated Waaagh! energy, the Weirdboy's body is wracked with green lightning that crawls from his eyes. The Weirdboy must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or take [[1d5]] Energy Damage, ignoring armour and Toughness Bonus Additionally, for the next [[1d5]] hours, add +10 to all rolls he must make on Table 3-2: Weird Fings","Scein' Green: A bewildering mist fills the battlefield, preventing anyone from being able to tell friend from foe. All creatures within 100 metres must pass a Hard (-20) Willpower Test or lose the ability to tell enemies and allies apart for [[1d5]] Rounds. Failure means that a creature must attack the nearest creature, perceiving it as a threat.","Err... I forgot: The Weirdboy's memory of the power he has just unleashed leaves its mind along with the energy fuelling it. For the next 24 hours, the Weirdboy cannot attempt to use that power and gains [[1d10]] Insanity Points from his confusion.","WAA-: The Weirdboy vanishes with a flash of green light and a cloud of vile-smelling smoke. [[1d5]] Rounds later, the Weirdboy reappears, [[1d10]] metres in a random horizontal direction from his original position. He gains [[1d5]] Insanity Points as a result of this strange disappearance, and refuses to discuss the experience.","What Wuz I Doin' Again?: The Weirdboy suddenly has no memory of where he is and what he's doing and even loses track of what power he was attempting to use. Instead of the power's normal effects, roll on Table 4–5: Powa' Burst Effects to determine which power is used instead, and determine the target (if any) randomly from amongst those in range.","Dis iz Gunna Hurt!: Whether through enthusiasm or panic, the Weirdboy loses control over the power, causing it to surge wildly at every target within range. The power works, but instead of affecting its normal target, it is resolved against the Weirdboy, as well as on every other creature within the power's range. If the power's effects are beneficial, it deals [[1d10]] Energy Damage to all recipients in addition to its normal effects.","Hot-hot-hot-hot!: The Weirdboy's head suddenly and inexplicably catches fire. The Weirdboy counts as being on fire, suffering any Damage from being aflame to his Head.","-AAGH!: An exact duplicate of the Weirdboy appears [[1d10]] metres away in a random direction, and after a moment of disorientation, begins attacking the Weirdboy. This is a hostile creature with rules and capabilities identical to that of the Weirdboy that devotes all of its Actions to the destruction of the original. The copy, and anything brought with it, vanishes after [[1d5]] Rounds or when it is slain. The Weirdboy gains [[1d10]] Insanity Points from the bizarre occurrence and a nagging sense of déjà vu.","Crazy Spores: A pale green fog erupts from the Weirdboy's flesh, launching countless billions of spores. The Weirdboy and any other creature within 10 metres must pass a Difficult (-10) Toughness Test or roll on Table 5-3: Hallucinogen Effects on page 146 of the Dark Heresy Core Rulebook. Anyone who fails this Test, including the Weirdboy, gains [[1d5]] Insanity Points.","'Eadswap!: The Weirdboy stretches his consciousness a bit too far and accidentally launches it into another creature. The Weirdboy and one random being (excluding Daemons, untouchables, machines, and other soulless creatures) targeted by the power that triggered this effect swap consciousnesses for [[1d10]] Rounds. This may include allies or even enemy combatants. Each creature retains its Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship during the swap, but all other Characteristics are those of the host body. If either body is slain, the effect ends immediately, and the survivor suffers [[1d10]] Insanity Points. If both survive the effect, both creatures suffer [[1d5]] Insanity Points from the experience. If the power had no eligible creatures as among its targets, the Weirdboy merely falls prey to the delusion that it has become a single creature or object in its line of sight for [[1d5]] Rounds, and spends that time behaving accordingly, gaining [[2d10]] Insanity Points.","Psychic Vomit: The Weirdboy feels the power build up within his brain, and expels it the only way he can think of quickly. The wild torrent knocks the Weirdboy prone, while casting the Deff Wave Psychic Technique (see page 107) in a random direction.","Gork Smashl: The area around the Weirdboy is smashed flat as if the fist of Gork (or possibly Mork) had descended from the sky to mete out the god's brutal cunning (or cunning brutality). Anyone within [[4d10]] metres of the Weirdboy (and the Weirdboy himself) must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test to drop prone or take [[1d10+5]] Impact Damage with the Shocking Quality","Waaagh!-valanche: A surge of green power erupts from the Weirdboy. The wave of energy travels [[5d10]]m in all directions and any creature within that distance must pass a Hard (-20) Strength Test or be knocked prone and be Stunned for [[1d5]] Rounds. The Weirdboy, caught at the epicentre, suffers [[2d10+5]] Impact Damage and is Stunned for [[1d5+2]] Rounds.","Where'd Da Git Go?: With a crack of thunder and a small mushroom cloud of green smoke, the Weirdboy is thrown [[3d10]] meters into the air, falling to the ground moments later (see page 243 of the Dark Heresy Core Rulebook for Falling Damage).","Squigs! Squigs Everywhere!: Clusters of tiny Squigs worm their way out of the ground, growing larger in moments. [[2d10]] Squigs (see page 57) immediately appear within 30m of the Weirdboy, each rabid beast attacking the nearest creature.","Waaagh!-ruption!: The Weirdboy's brain overloads on Waaagh! energy and bolts of green lightning arc out at those nearby Anyone within [[1d10]] metres (including the Weirdboy) takes [[2d10]] Energy Damage with a Penetration value equal to his Psy Rating. The Weirdboy may not Dodge this effect or avoid it in any other way. In addition, all of the Weirdboy's clothing and gear is destroyed, leaving him naked on the ground with green smoke pouring from his ears and mouth. He gains [[3d10]] Insanity Points.","Kaboom!: The Weirdboy's head detonates with a loud boom and a small green mushroom cloud, killing him outright. His body responds slowly to this development and continues to run around the battlefield, flailing about at random, for [[1d5]] Rounds.","'Ead A'splodel: The Weirdboy's head explodes with the force of the psychic energy surging within his skull. The Weirdboy is slain instantly and all other Greenskins within 10m must immediately pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer the same fate.

This effect lasts for [[1d5]] rounds before lessening to a Major Disruption (and then dissipating as normal)."

FORTYKTABLES.hallucinogenic=["<b>Bugsbugsbugsbugs!</b> The character drops to the floor, flailing and screaming as he tries to claw off imaginary insects devouring his skin and flesh. The character gains the Prone and Stunned conditions.","<b>My hands...!</b> The character believes his hands have turned into slimy tentacles, or perhaps the flesh has begun to strip off the bone in bloody lumps. Regardless of the particulars, the character drops everything he is carrying and spends the duration staring at his hands and screaming. The character is Stunned.","<b>They're coming through the walls!</b> The character sees gruesome aliens bursting through the walls/ceiling/floor/bushes and opens fire. The character must spend each turn firing at a random piece of terrain within his line of sight. Any creatures caught in the line of fire are subject to attacks as normal. Each round, choose a new target at random (use the Scatter Diagram on page 230) to determine which direction that is, with a 7 meaning he shoots the ground, and a 10 meaning he fires wildly into the air.","<b>Nobody can see me!</b> The character believes he is invisible and wanders aimlessly, making faces at those around him. He waddles about in random directions each round (use the Scatter Diagram on page 230), using a Full Action to move. The character retains his Reactions.","<b>I can fly!</b> The sky looks so big and inviting, the character flaps his arms trying to imitate a pterasquirrel. He might do nothing but jump up and down on the spot. If he is standing above ground level, he may throw himself off in a random direction, with the usual consequences for falling—appalling injury or death being the likely outcomes.","<b>They've got it in for me...!</b> The character is overcome with paranoia, believing even his own comrades are out to get him. On the character's turn, he must move to a position of cover, getting out of line of sight from any other characters. He remains hidden until the effect ends, moving to new cover as needed to stay as hidden as possible.","<b>They got me!</b> The character believes that the gas is toxic and collapses to the floor as if dead; he counts as being Helpless. Other characters who sees him die must pass a Challenging (+0) Intelligence test; should they fail then they also think the character is dead.","<b>I'll take you all on!</b> The character is filled with a burning rage and a desire for violence. The character becomes Frenzied (see page 127) for the duration of the effects, and must attack the closest opponent.","<b>I'm only little!</b> The character believes he has shrunk to half his normal size and everything else is big and frightening now. All other characters count as having the Fear (3) trait to the character.","<b>The worms!</b> The character desperately tries to remove a massive fanged worm he thinks is slowly winding its way up his leg. If holding a gun, he shoots himself with it or, if not, he hits himself in the leg with whatever melee weapon he is holding. If the character is currently holding no weapon, he draws a random weapon from those he carries and attacks himself with it. Randomly determine which leg the character believes to be trapped by the worm. The attack automatically inflicts a single hit with [[1d5]] degrees of success that deals damage normally."]
